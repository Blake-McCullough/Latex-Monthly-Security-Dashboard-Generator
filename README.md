This is from a project I worked on during my internship with ES2.



How it works, is that the Latex takes the data from the CSV Files and will use those to create the graphs,tables etc

The advantage of Latex over word etc, is that it can be run from terminal(after programmed) and when an item is set to be in a specific area, it will stay there, unlike how word moves it around.

It automatically works out the current month, and the month six months ago for the data, Takes the company name(For the company the product is being given to) from a text file and sets that accordingly.

The system also has some pre generated text at the bottom which depending on the circumstances will automatically decide what to say, e.g. if there is a rise in attacks then it will say there was one.

This was all done to allow for automatic generation of a report, However I am still working on that part of the project.
Still looking for ideas!

During this I learnt that certain variables cannot be set as they mess with the code! Any ideas feel free to create an issue and I will give it a shot!



Any questions feel free to reach out!
